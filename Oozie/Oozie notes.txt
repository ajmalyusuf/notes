Oozie notes:

Changes from 2.1 to 2.2 :

In 2.1 the the haddop fonfs (/etc/hadoop/conf), was packed and sent to Oozie Server and loaded to oozie launcher job.
In 2.1, this the hadoop conf should be manually put to the sharelib path in the HDFS - /user/oozie/share/lib
and defined in oozie.service.WorkflowAppService.system.libpath

When yarn-site properties are changed from Ambari, it does not automatically upload the changed xml to HDFS. It has to be done manually




Check oozie connection:
curl -i -negotiate -u foo:bar -X GET http://hdp-s1.hw.com:11000/oozie/v1/admin/build-version

The above did not work - below worked:

curl --negotiate -u foo:bar -X GET http://hdp-s1.hw.com:11000/oozie/v1/admin/build-version
