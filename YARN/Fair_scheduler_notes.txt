Fair_scheduler_notes.txt

Fair Scheduler:

- an equal share of resources over time
- By default, the Fair Scheduler bases scheduling fairness decisions only on memory (can be configured baseed on CPU also)

- Within each queue, a scheduling policy is used to share resources between the running applications
- The default is memory-based fair sharing, but FIFO and multi-resource with Dominant Resource Fairness can also be configured
