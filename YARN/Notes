Yarm Container Calculations:
http://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/HDP2/HDP-2.3.2/bk_installing_manually_book/content/determine-hdp-memory-config.html

The next calculation is to determine the maximum number of containers allowed per node. The following formula can be used:

# of containers = min (2*CORES, 1.8*DISKS, (Total available RAM) / MIN_CONTAINER_SIZE)

Where DISKS is the value for dfs.data.dirs (number of data disks) per machine.

And MIN_CONTAINER_SIZE is the minimum container size (in RAM). This value is dependent on the amount of RAM available -- in smaller memory nodes, the minimum container size should also be smaller. The following table outlines the recommended values:

Customer has 10 disks, 18 core and 128G RAM per machine
What is the maximum number of containers they should run for MRv2 based on our guidelines?

Cores : 2 * 18 = 36
Disk : 1.8 * 10 = 18
RAM = (128 * 1024) / 2048 = 64

So 18 Containers.
