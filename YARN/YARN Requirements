YARN Requirements

To summarize the requirements for YARN, we need the following features:

[1] Scalability:
The next-generation compute platform should scale horizontally to tens of thousands of nodes and concurrent applications.

[2] Serviceability:
The next-generation compute platform should enable evolution of cluster software to be completely decoupled from users’ applications.

[3] Multitenancy:
The next-generation compute platform should support multiple tenants to coexist on the same cluster and enable fine- grained sharing of individual nodes among different tenants.

[4] Locality Awareness:
The next-generation compute plat- form should support locality awareness—moving computation to the data is a major win for many applications.

[5] High Cluster Utilization:
The next-generation compute platform should enable high utilization of the underlying physical resources.

[6] Secure and Auditable Operation:
The next-generation compute platform should continue to enable secure and auditable usage of cluster resources.

[7] Reliability and Availability:
The next-generation com- pute platform should have a very reliable user interaction and support high availability.

[8] Support for Programming Model Diversity:
The next- generation compute platform should enable diverse programming models and evolve beyond just being MapReduce-centric.

[9] Flexible Resource Model:
The next-generation compute platform should enable dynamic resource configurations on individual nodes and a flexible resource model.

[10] Backward Compatibility:
The next-generation compute platform should maintain completely backward compatibility of existing Map- Reduce applications.
