troubleshooting

- Are all services running?
- Can you run query in Hive CLI vs HS2 (HiveServer2)?
- Can you run simple query?
- is there a problem with DDL?
- Is there a resource contention in the cluster?
- Can you run query using MR vs Tez?
	- set hive.execution.engine=mr
	- set hive.execution.engine=tez
- What kind of optimizations are turned on (known issues)?
	- like "set true hive.optimize.sort.dynamic.partition=false", if this is set to true, it causes some issues
- check HDFS permissions
- you can run dfs commands from hive / beeline prompt:
	hive > dfs -ls /tmp;

	to run hive in DEBUG mode:
	hive -hiveconf hive.root.logger=DEBUG,console -f file.hql 2>&1 | tee 1.txt

	hive > describe formatted <database>.<tablename>;
	hive > describe extended <tablename>;

	hive > show create table <tablename> ;

Need to ensure that the HDFS data has a field delimiter and hive is serde property is set to that. If not, the result may be null.

If the delimiter in HDFS file is a "," then,
alter table <tablename> set serdeproperties('field.delim'=',');

How to switch between running MR jobs to running Tez jobs in the same Hive session?

SOLUTION:  

To switch from running Tez jobs to running MR jobs, run the following command in Hive.

1) set set hive.execution.engine=mr; 

2) set mapreduce.framework.name=yarn;


To switch from running MR jobs to running Tez jobs, run the following command in Hive.

1) set set hive.execution.engine=tez; 

2) set mapreduce.framework.name=yarn-tez (optional, if Tez is the default framework)
