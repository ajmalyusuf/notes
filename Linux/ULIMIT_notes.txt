What is “soft” limit vs “hard” limit for ulimit?
A hard limit is the maximum allowed to a user, set by the superuser/root. This value is set in the file /etc/security/limits.conf. Think of it as an upper bound or ceiling or roof.
A soft limit is the effective value right now for that user. The user can increase the soft limit on their own in times of needing more resources, but cannot set the soft limit higher than the hard limit.
