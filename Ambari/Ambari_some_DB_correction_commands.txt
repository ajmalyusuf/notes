ROOTCAUSE: The customer has an issue connecting to Cluster hosted in Cloud through Ambari. As part of the trouble shooting, the customer ran ambari setup selecting all default option. The actual issue was related to network connectivity. The "ambari setup" pointed the DB to the default postgres database; however the ambari was originally configured to use mysql database.

RESOLUTION: Re ran the Ambari setup to point the DB to the existing mysql database. Once this was done, all the cluster components were appearing in Ambari UI and was able to operate from Ambari UI.
