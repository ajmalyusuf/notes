Moving_Historyserver_to_another_host.txt

We cannot move history server from Ambari UI.

We need to use Ambari CURL commands to do this.

1> Stop History server from Ambari. 

2> Run the below command

curl -u admin:admin -H "X-Requested-By:ambari" -i -X GET http://AMBARI_HOST:8080/api/v1/clusters/CLUSTER_NAME/hosts/OLD_SERVER_HOSTNAME/host_components/HISTORYSERVER

This should show history server details.

3> Run this command to set make sure History server is Stopped completely.

 curl -u admin:admin -H "X-Requested-By:ambari" -X PUT -d '{"HostRoles": {"state": "INSTALLED"}}' http://AMBARI_HOST:8080/api/v1/clusters/CLUSTER_NAME/hosts/OLD_SERVER_HOSTNAME/host_components/HISTORYSERVER


4> Delete the History server 

curl -u admin:admin -H "X-Requested-By:ambari" -i -X DELETE http://AMBARI_HOST:8080/api/v1/clusters/CLUSTER_NAME/hosts/OLD_SERVER_HOSTNAME/host_components/HISTORYSERVER


5> Add the history server on the new host

curl -u admin:admin -H "X-Requested-By:ambari" -i -X POST http://AMBARI_HOST:8080/api/v1/clusters/CLUSTER_NAME/hosts/NEW_SERVER_HOSTNAME/host_components/HISTORYSERVER


After this, go to Ambari UI --> Click on MapReduce2 --> Click on History server --> In the drop down next to History server, select Reinstal

Before starting the History server, go to Advanced mapred-site  and change the mapreduce.jobhistory.webapp.address to the new host and save the settings.

Start history server now.
