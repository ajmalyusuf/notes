MIT_Kerberos.txt

Setting KRB5 configuration: 
1) To download and install MIT Kerberos for Windows 4.0.1: 
To download the Kerberos installer for 64-bit computers, 
http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/dist/kfw/4.0/kfw-4.0.1-amd64.msi 
OR 
To download the Kerberos installer for 32-bit computers, 
http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/dist/kfw/4.0/kfw-4.0.1-i386.msi 

Note: The 64-bit installer includes both 32-bit and 64-bit libraries. 

2) Open the file C:\ProgramData\MIT\Kerberos5\krb5.ini as administrator 
(it may be a blank file) 

3) Copy past the entire krb5.conf content from one of the nodes in the Linux cluster to the above "krb5.ini" file 

4) Create a System Environment variable with below details: 
Variable name : KRB5CCNAME 
Variable value : C:\Temp\krb5cache 
(Ensure that C:\Temp is present. krb5cache is NOT a directory; it will be a file created by MIT Kerberos. Do not create any file with this name. 

5) Create a headless principal in your name in the Linux Cluster KDC, for example : 
Perform these on the KDC server - creating a principal as "myname@REALM" by giving a password. Remember the password to use in MIT Kerberos authentication. 

# kadmin.local 
Authenticating as principal root/admin@SUPPORT.COM with password. 
kadmin.local: addprinc myname 
WARNING: no policy specified for myname@SUPPORT.COM; defaulting to no policy 
Enter password for principal "myname@SUPPORT.COM": 
Re-enter password for principal "myname@SUPPORT.COM": 
Principal "myname@SUPPORT.COM" created. 
kadmin.local: 

6) Use this principal and password to authenticate before using Firefox. 

-------------------------------- 
Firefox Configs: 
Got to firefox and type: "about:config" in the URL 

1) Set : 
network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris = hdp.com 
(domain name for example, if the hostname is n1-c03-211.hdp.com, then use "hdp.com") 

2) Set: 
network.auth.use-sspi = false 
(the default is double click to change to false; it will be highlighted in bold) 

3) Restart Firefox.
